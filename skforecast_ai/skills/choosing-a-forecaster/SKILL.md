# Choosing a Forecaster

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user needs help choosing a forecaster, comparing forecaster types (recursive vs direct, single vs multi-series), or understanding which skforecast class fits their problem.

## Overview

Skforecast is a **machine learning-first** library. The ML forecasters are the primary tools; statistical models (`ForecasterStats`) and naive baselines (`ForecasterEquivalentDate`) serve as comparison benchmarks.

## Step 1 — How Many Series?

| Scenario | Go to |
|----------|-------|
| **1 target series** (with or without exogenous variables) | → Step 2a |
| **Multiple series** to forecast simultaneously | → Step 2b |
| **Multiple series as drivers** to predict one target | → `ForecasterDirectMultiVariate` |
| **Categorical target** (e.g., low/medium/high) | → `ForecasterRecursiveClassifier` |

## Step 2a — Single Series

| Scenario | Recommended Forecaster | Why |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| **General purpose** (start here) | `ForecasterRecursive` | Default choice. One model, recursive multi-step. Works with any sklearn-compatible estimator (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest, etc.). Supports lags, window features, exog, differentiation, transformers, weight functions, and all probabilistic prediction methods (bootstrapping, conformal, quantiles, distributions) |
| **Horizon-dependent patterns** (e.g., predicting at 1h vs 24h requires different relationships) | `ForecasterDirect` | Trains one independent model per step — no error propagation. Better when the predictive relationship changes significantly across the forecast horizon. Requires `steps` at init; parallelizable with `n_jobs` |
| **Statistical baseline** | `ForecasterStats` | Wraps ARIMA, SARIMAX, ETS, ARAR. Use as a benchmark to compare against ML models, or when the series is very short (< 200 obs) and ML overfits |
| **Zero-shot / cold-start / no training data** | `ForecasterFoundation` | Wraps pre-trained foundation models (Chronos-2, TimesFM 2.5, Moirai-2, TabICL, TabPFN-TS, TFC-T0). `fit()` only stores context — no training. Good baseline and cold-start option. See the `foundation-forecasting` skill |
| **Naive baseline** | `ForecasterEquivalentDate` | Predicts using equivalent past dates (e.g., same weekday last week). Use as a sanity-check baseline |

## Step 2b — Multiple Series

| Scenario | Recommended Forecaster | Why |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| **Forecast many series with a shared model** (start here) | `ForecasterRecursiveMultiSeries` | One global model learns cross-series patterns. Supports DataFrame or dict input (dict allows series with different date ranges). Encoding options: `'ordinal'` (default), `'ordinal_category'`, `'onehot'`, `None`. Supports per-series transformers, per-series differentiation, series_weights |
| **Other series are features for one target** | `ForecasterDirectMultiVariate` | All series become input features to predict a single `level`. Per-series lags via dict (`{'sales': [1,7], 'price': [1]}`). One model per step — no error propagation |
| **Deep learning / complex nonlinear patterns** | `ForecasterRnn` | Keras-based RNN/LSTM/GRU. Single model outputs all steps and levels simultaneously via 3D tensors. Only conformal intervals (no bootstrapping). Requires keras |
| **Zero-shot / pre-trained generalist** | `ForecasterFoundation` | Global zero-shot forecasts via Chronos-2 / TimesFM 2.5 / Moirai-2 / TabICL / TabPFN-TS / TFC-T0. `fit()` only stores context. Native quantile intervals. Chronos-2, TabICL, TabPFN-TS, and TFC-T0 support exog; TimesFM 2.5 & Moirai-2 do not. See the `foundation-forecasting` skill |

| Models trained | 1 | N (one per step) |
| Error propagation | Yes (predictions feed into next step) | No (each step uses only observed data) |
| Forecast horizon | Flexible (any `steps` at predict time) | Fixed at init (`steps` required) |
| Training speed | Fast (one model) | Slower (N models, parallelizable via `n_jobs`) |

## Quick Start Recommendations

Once you have chosen a forecaster, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Define your problem**: 1 series → `ForecasterRecursive`; multiple series → `ForecasterRecursiveMultiSeries`
2. **Choose an estimator**: LightGBM (`LGBMRegressor`) is the best starting point — fast, handles categoricals, good defaults
3. **Add features**: Use `RollingFeatures` (rolling mean, std, min, max) and `CalendarFeatures` or `create_calendar_features` as exogenous variables
4. **Handle non-stationarity**: Use the `differentiation` parameter instead of manual differencing
5. **Evaluate with backtesting**: `backtesting_forecaster` + `TimeSeriesFold` for realistic multi-step evaluation
6. **Tune hyperparameters**: `bayesian_search_forecaster` (Optuna-based) — can include `lags` in the search space
7. **Add prediction intervals**: `predict_interval(method='bootstrapping', use_binned_residuals=True)` for uncertainty quantification
8. **Compare with baselines**: Use `ForecasterStats` (Auto-ARIMA: `Arima(order=None)`) and `ForecasterEquivalentDate` to verify the ML model adds value
