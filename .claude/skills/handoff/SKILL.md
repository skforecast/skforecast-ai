# Handoff

Write `dev/handoff_$ARGUMENTS.md` (ask for a slug if none was given;
overwrite it if it already exists for this topic), in the language of the
conversation:

1. Title and one line of state: date, branch, and whether the changes are
   committed (and pushed) or only in the working tree.
2. Goal and decisions: what we are trying to achieve and why each
   non-obvious decision was taken, including the options discarded and any
   measurements that supported them.
3. Done: grouped by topic, with the public names and files that changed,
   and whether each block has tests and a release note in
   `docs/releases/releases.md`.
4. Pending: for the author (review, commit, decisions, real-model runs)
   and for the next session, in order, each item concrete enough to start
   without rereading this conversation.
5. Environment and verification: the exact commands to check the state
   (from `/verify`), and the result at the end of this session (test
   count, lint).

Keep it factual and short; link to files instead of copying code.

Do not commit it unless asked. In a cloud session it must reach the remote
to be read elsewhere: commit it to the session branch together with the
rest of the work, and remind the user to delete it before the pull request
is merged. The `handoff_` prefix tells it apart from the notes that `dev/`
versions on purpose; `/open-pr` keeps it out of the pull request.
